The Spck Editor is a lightweight mobile code editor for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Install Spck Editor:

script.js: JavaScript for interactivity.




3. Write the HTML (index.html):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>PuneVibe Restaurant</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
